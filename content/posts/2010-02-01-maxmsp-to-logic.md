This is the sort of thing where there's probably a video out there already explaining it, but as I ended up figuring it out myself anyway, I thought I might as well make my own video… This is how to send midi information from Max/MSP to Logic Pro, in particular how to use Max to control the automation parameters of a softsynth running in Logic. Probably best to watch these fullscreeen; http://youtu.be/8nHpYZkgi1A http://youtu.be/mA3-vTIpkXQ
