I'm interested in now taking the SuperCollider livecoding techniques that I've developed in the context of algorave and applying them to the creation of fixed media sound works. Here is one, using some prepared piano samples that Dr Kurt James Werner has been kind enough to put [online](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~kwerner/samples_such.html).

It's not perfect: there is still a strong element of improvisation in this way of working, and there are places in this track where, on listening back, I might have wished to have performed differently. A compromise, perhaps, between the raw and the cooked.
