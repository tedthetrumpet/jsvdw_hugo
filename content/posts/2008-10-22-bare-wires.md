I'm putting in a proposal to [Cryptic Nights](http://crypticnights.org.uk/2008/09/welcome-to-cryptic-nights/) to do a show called, to give it its full title, Ted Edwards proudly presents Bare Wires - Live in concert or just Bare Wires for short. Below I've gathered together in one place some relevant video and other documentation;

'The Other Other Hand' is pretty much fully documented from initial ideas to final performance at [workingtitle08.blogspot.com](http://workingtitle08.blogspot.com/) - the best place to start is probably the three-minute preview video at the top of that page, also [available on YouTube](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Fozb7LIK0). A fully edited 80 minute edited video of the complete show is online [here](http://www.archive.org/details/TheOtherOtherHand).

Also on [my YouTube page](http://uk.youtube.com/user/tedthetrumpet) are [two](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=z2VM4ui3xCU) [videos](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=BO6k9rjIFWg) which show one of the starting points for the Ted Edwards project; my fortuitous discovery of several pieces of interesting retro music gear discarded in the street near where I live, in this case a Novation BassStation synth.

Further down this blog you will find some information about the forthcoming performance of a new commission The Whirlies for the Scottish Philharmonic Orchestra at [Òran Mór](http://www.oran-mor.co.uk/page/Concert_Cocktail_Canap_202.html) on November 17th. This will be the first show in which I myself appear in my Ted Edwards role; below you will find a photo and description of the gear to be used, plus a demo recording of the piece.

For a thorough background on my work for the last twenty years or so, go to [jsimonvanderwalt.com](http://www.jsimonvanderwalt.com/) - particularly relevant to Bare Wires might be the Openings series of works, such as [CIRCULARTHING](http://www.jsimonvanderwalt.com/catalog/circular.html), the score for which is shortly to be published in [Notations 21](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn%3A9780979554643), a followup book to John Cage's seminal 1968 collection of graphic scores 'Notations'.
