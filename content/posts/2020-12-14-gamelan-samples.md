This is just a quick post to pull together links to a number of places online where I have offered up gamelan sounds for download. It's all a bit chaotic! Most of these are from the pelog Spirit of Hope instruments in Glasgow, sometimes retuned. Some of them may be from other sources that I've forgotten about.

From my perspective, these are all inteneded to be CC0 'No rights reserved' â€“ you can do what you like with them!

If I've accidentally uploaded someone else's sample here and you want me to take it down, please let me know.
