I've been teaching some of the composition students at the [Royal Conservatoire of Scotland](http://www.rcs.ac.uk/) how to livecode in [Estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca/), and we're going to do a short set as part of [The Longest Night](https://night.tidalcycles.org/). Here's the test I just did for that, which sort of counts as another one of my tiny estuary jams – not a very interesting one!
