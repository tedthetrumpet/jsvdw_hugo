My institution, [The Royal Conservatoire of Glasgow](http://www.rcs.ac.uk), have sent me on a trip to make connections with a number of potential partners in Indonesia, including the [UPH Conservatory of Music](https://www.uph.edu/), the [Jakarta Institute of Arts](http://www.ikj.ac.id/) (IKJ), and [Institut Seni Indonesia Surakarta](http://isi-ska.ac.id/) (ISI Solo). I'll also be visiting Singapore to see [Setan Jawa](https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/pesta-raya-malay-festival-of-arts/2017/setan-jawa), and talk to the producers about bringing this to Glasgow for a Festival of Gamelan and the Moving Image that we are planning here for September.

Here's the poster for a workshop I'll be giving at UPH, that will take in a [livecoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhprsv_c27o) demo and a performance of [Steadily-Stop!](http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/works/steadily/) alongside an analysis of [Antichthon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxzEb0xJi_8).
