Having a very positive experience at the moment with [Ubuntu Studio 17.04](http://ubuntustudio.org/) running [SuperCollider 3.8.0](http://supercollider.github.io/) on a £150 refurb 11" Dell Inspiron. Apart from an initial UEFI glitch with getting it to boot, Ubuntu Studio installed easily and works seamlessly so far. The SuperCollider install was made simple by this script [install\_supercollider\_sc3plugins\_buntu.sh](https://gist.github.com/theseanco/38a5108e4b75c71f9a9d723c43e8de84) from [@theseansco](https://twitter.com/theseanco)  – thanks Sean! When it came to actually booting SuperCollider, I did not even need to mess around with Jack or any other at all, everything on the audio side seems to just work. Now to push it a little harder…
