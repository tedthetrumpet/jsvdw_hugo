I've finally managed to persuade Ted to let me post some of the amazing back catalog he's built up over the years. Below is a piece called 'slacion' which he did 'sometime in the late 70s', using an adapted version of the [PE Minisonic](http://pcbunn.cacr.caltech.edu/jjb/Synthesizers/Minisonic2/default.htm) synth plus tape loops plus a spring reverb. The video is also by Ted, a recent digital remix of 'some old Betamax that's up in the loft'. I can't wait to find out what else he has up there… [](http://www.youtube.com/v/wrJ3cSXfiqY&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0 "Click here to block this object with Adblock Plus")\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrJ3cSXfiqY&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0\]
