[![Picture of Silviya Mihaylova](http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/img_62881.jpg?w=199 "IMG_6288")](http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/img_62881.jpg)I'm happy to say that my collaboration with pianist [Silviya Mihaylova](http://silviyamihaylova.com/) _The Seventh Voyage_, for two pianos and laptop, has been given pride of place as the closing work in the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland's piano festival.

The concert is at 1300 this Monday 12 March, in the Guinness Room. Tickets are available from the RCS box office, although, confusingly, they still have the wrong concert listed on the website [https://boxoffice.rcs.ac.uk/](https://boxoffice.rcs.ac.uk/), it's billed as 'Piano and Strings'. Tickets are Â£7/5.

**Update** also on the programme, all piano musice: Haydn Sonata in E Major, Liszt Spanish Rhapsody, Enescu Pavana and Silvestri Baccanale.
