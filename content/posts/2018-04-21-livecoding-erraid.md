On a number of occasions I have used [sounds](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/areyousamplingit) [collected](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/stadtrad) at a [particular location](https://jsimonvanderwalt.com/2016/10/06/rave-the-space/) as a coherent set of resources for a livecoded set. For the last week I've been in retreat on with the [community on the isle of Erraid](http://www.erraid.com/), which has been a welcome break from the city!

One of the features of the island is the 'observatory'. This is a circular tin structure, about two meters across by three high: a restored remnant of the building of the Dubh Artach lighthouse that took place there between 1867 and 1872.

The sound world inside this unusual structure is distinctive. I took some recordings (available on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/tedthetrumpet/), or they will be once the finish uploading), that I am going to be using in a livecoded SuperCollider improvisation this Monday during one of the 'Sonic Nights' series at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where staff and students diffuse new electroacoustic works on a multi-channel sound system. If it seems practical, I may stream the performance as well.
