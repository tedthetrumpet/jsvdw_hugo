I've been working on a piece for this year's Plug festival at the [Royal Conservatoire of Scotland](http://www.rcs.ac.uk), which will be in May sometime. The theme this time round is 'postludes'. Head of Composition [Gordon McPherson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b2TL26QgNU) has invited all the composers here, including staff like myself, to compose something which draws on, or reflects, or comments upon in some way, a piece from a previous Plug festival.

I've found myself drawn immediately to one of Gordon's own pieces from 2007, 'Spiricom', part of a trilogy of pieces called 'Ghosts' which deal in various ways with death and a possible afterlife. 'Spiricom' refers to... we'll, you can [google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=spiricom), a strange and mad episode in the history of pseudoscience, a couple of cranks who convinced themselves they had built a machine which would talk to dead people.

My postlude will be for solo clarinet and acoustic laptop: by which I mean a laptop operating entirely by itself, using just the internal mics and speakers. I've written a patch in Pd which will (quietly) transform long notes played by the clarinet, these long notes being a (very) approximate by-ear transcription of certain passages within Gordon's original piece. I have Fraser Langton lined up to play the clarinet, and we've had a wee try out with the patch: sounds ok.

A frustrating, ugly, boring piece to listen to, I imagine. But it will only be short :)
