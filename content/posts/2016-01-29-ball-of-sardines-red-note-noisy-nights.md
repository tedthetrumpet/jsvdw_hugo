Just for fun, I did an arrangement of [Ball of Sardines](http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/2015/12/31/working-on-new-music-for-gamelan/) for one of Red Note's ‘[Noisy Nights](http://www.rednoteensemble.com/event/noisy-nights-summerhall-edinburgh/)’: flute violin, trombone, and the conductor playing kethuk. (This is instead of the piece I was going to write, a masterpiece of algorithmic pointilism to be entitled ‘Moment of Indecision’. I may finish that one day…)
