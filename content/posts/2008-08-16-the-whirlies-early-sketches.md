I have a commission for another piece from the Scottish Philharmonic Orchestra, for a concert at [Òran Mór](http://www.oran-mor.co.uk/) in Glasgow on 17 November. It's going to be called 'The Whirlies', which is a famous [roundabout](http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/60265) in East Kilbride; to be the first movement of a suite dedicated to the, er, roundabouts of East Kilbride!

The piece is essentially for strings, but - and I haven't exactly told them this yet - I intend to turn up and do some [live electro-junk impro](https://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/nolap-first-sap.mp3) along with the piece as well.

Two bits of string material so far;
