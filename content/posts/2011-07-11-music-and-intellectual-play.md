![](http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/125030-l.jpg?w=186 "Cover of 'Thinking Musically'")Next year at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland I'm going to be sharing the teaching of the Teaching Musics of the World module with my colleage Barnaby Brown. I was doing some background reading, having a look at Bonnie C. Wade's '[Thinking Musically](http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/he/subject/Music/MusicAppreciation/IntroductiontoWorldMusic/?ci=9780195341911 "Thinking Musically")', which is one of the overview volumes in OUPs 'Global Music Series'. This is just an undergrad textbook, but I did stumble upon on a notion which set me thinking, where she discusses 'intellectual play':

> Intellectual play as well as aesthetic choice are the major factors in an improvisatory South Indian performance practice called _rāgamālikā_ ("garland of ragas"). _Rāgamālikā_ comprises a progression from one _rāga_ to another, each sufficiently similar that one must listen closely to detect the shift, but sufficiently different that contrast has been achieved. The intellectual play is enhanced when, in vocal _rāgamālikā_, the names of the new modes are introduced into the text, embedded in clever ways. (p126)

As ever, I find comparisons with the practices of other musical cultures illuminating with regard to my own work. There are so many _ideas_ in my pieces: things which are there primarily for intellectual reasons. Which sounds bad and wrong, doesn't it! Describing music as _intellectual_ is a criticism, isn't it? Especially if I were to _self-describe_ my music as intellectual?
