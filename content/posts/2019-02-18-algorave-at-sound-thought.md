I shared an algorave spot at Sound Thought with [Claire Quigley](http://www.clairequigley.net/), that was streamed as part of the [TOPLAP 15th anniversary stream](https://toplap.org/toplap-15th-anniversary-stream-14-17th-february-2019/). You can see her set [here](https://youtu.be/qKFrHzQqj48) and mine is [here](https://youtu.be/-bQNGCqTc0A), although I have to say not that happy with the way my performance turned out on the day. The rehearsal was better:

As you can see, combining my livecoding work with my passion for table tennis! And, in fact, this was a new technical discovery just the day before: it is possible to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) to livecode simultaneously in [Hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra) and SuperCollider, using a [plugin](https://atom.io/packages/supercollider) for SC. I'm not sure this is intended behaviour, but in practice if you have Hydra running in Atom and then switch to a page of SC code, the Hydra visuals run on behind that code.

Amongst other things, Claire is a colleage of mine at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where she teaches coding to the music education students. We're hoping to do more work together in the future.
