Mags and I were enjoying a pleasant evening walk in [Maxwell Park](https://friendsofmaxwellpark.wordpress.com/ "http://www.friendsofmaxwellpark.co.uk/"), when she had a lucky find: a pound coin sitting on the grass beside a metal park bench. We had some fun sitting in the sun and improvising with the sound of the bench and the coin, which I recorded on my new HTC Wildfire S Android phone. I made the track in Logic using nothing but those sounds: fairly minimal effects, just some pitch shifting and fake stereo. Sort of an urban gamelan thingâ€¦
