I'm looking for music and/or visual artists working with live code who are interested in joining me for an improvised algorave as part of [Sound Thought 2019](http://www.soundthought.co.uk/sound-thought-2019/).

‘Livecoding’ is a practice where creative artists who work with computer code perform live, often producing music and/or visuals, with the audience typically able to watch the evolution of the code on a projected screen. ‘Algorave’ is a subgenre where the aim is to produce beat-driven music and/or visuals for dancing.

Examples of the kind of software we're talking about include:
