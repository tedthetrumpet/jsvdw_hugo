During January 2023 a number of people active in the livecoding community participated together in a 'patternuary' [https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/patternuary-2023/4474/1](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/patternuary-2023/4474/1) aiming to make one pattern every day during the month.

Some people worked in TidalCycles [https://tidalcycles.org/](https://tidalcycles.org/), while many chose to use the Strudel platform [https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/.](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/.)

Some of the patterns were posted on the Tidal Club thread above, while many otherers appeared under the #patternuary thread on Mastodon [https://post.lurk.org/tags/patternuary](https://post.lurk.org/tags/patternuary).

Given the strong likelihood of bitrot, I created a single video [https://archive.org/details/jsvdwpatternuary2023](https://archive.org/details/jsvdwpatternuary2023) that captures brief excerpts of all of the patterns I made: mostly in Strudel, but also in SuperCollider, Pd and one composition notated in MuseScore.

The audio is also released as an album on bandcamp: [https://tedthetrumpet.bandcamp.com/album/everyday-jan-63](https://tedthetrumpet.bandcamp.com/album/everyday-jan-63)

(Most of) the code is available as a gist [https://gist.github.com/tedthetrumpet/0410ae1cd2ad0a2837a36aca94e5b5ea](https://gist.github.com/tedthetrumpet/0410ae1cd2ad0a2837a36aca94e5b5ea)
