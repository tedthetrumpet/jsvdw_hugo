Â 

Back at the livecoding again. A couple of weeks ago, a quite succesful workshop for the students on the Interactive Composition module at the [Royal Conservatoire of Scotland](https://www.rcs.ac.uk/). Coming up: a couple of things. In March there is going to be another long-form online algorave that I'll be contributing a half-hour set to, Friday 16th at 1330 GMT. In April the METRIC Intensive III at the RCS sees staff and students converge on Glasgow for a week of improvisation: again, as well as leading some gamelan improvisation, expect to be SuperColliding as well.

Below, a more-or-less unedited trial run of some new stuff tonight: specifically, a collection of samples made purely from mechanical sounds of my trumpet, close-miked: springs, valve noise, slide pops and so forth.
