I've just spent a very stimulating weekend, combining an [algorave](http://algorave.com/about/) [in Brighton](https://www.facebook.com/events/246565025546701/) with the [Live Coding and the Body](http://www.livecodenetwork.org/body/) symposium at Sussex University. A packed weekend: I didn't keep notes of exactly who and what and when, so this is a rather chaotic reflection!

The algorave was in a clubby sort of room above a pub. Code from each performer's laptop was projected on a black behind them, while some livecoded visuals in IBNIZ were projected on an adjacent wall. A good atmosphere, although I found the gig sometimes painfully loud, especially with those very forward and raw sounds which you sometimes get from coded synths.

The first set I caught was [Chris Kiefer](http://luuma.net/), working in SuperCollider (the old, pre-IDE version, looked like). This was excellent: very approachable danceable grooves, with a nice line in slowly changing fx. After that, Aneurin Barker Snook did a set in [Tidal](http://yaxu.org/tidal/). It's the first time I've seen this [Haskell-based](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tidal) tool: to me it seemed quite firmly targetted at algorave, rather than a more general approach to coding music performance. A very harsh set, if I remember correctly, but still musical and interesting.

From this point on, my memory is a little blurred. A very abstract and glitchy set from [Norah Lorway](http://norahlorway.com/): not sure what tool she was using as she did not have time to plug into the projector. Also [Charlie Roberts](http://www.charlie-roberts.com/) playing his own web-based [Gibber](http://www.charlie-roberts.com/gibber/) language, with a nice line in livecoding the ascii text. Oh, and… [Mico Rex](https://twitter.com/micorexricomex) – bonkers! In a good way: cardboard boxes, SC code, and exuberant singing.

The symposium programme turned out to be a little different from [the published one](http://www.livecodenetwork.org/body/): once again, this will be a bit disorganised as I didn't keep accurate notes. A fascinating range of disciplines and interests in the room, including people working in music, fine art, architecture, dance, analog synthesis, social anthropology, and more. Some of the highlights I recall:

- [Marije Baalman](https://www.marijebaalman.eu/) gave a very, very cool performance of her piece 'Wezen', a tour-de-force of live SuperCollider code combined with sensor gloves.
- [Renick Bell'](http://www.renickbell.net)s presentation sparked off quite a lively debate, bringing to the table his reinterpretation of the pragmatic philosophy of [John Dewey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey). Some deep questioning of his philosophical approaches ensued, led by [David Berry](https://twitter.com/berrydm) in particular.
- [David Ogborn](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/ogbornd) gave us two treats. The first was a multi-layered coding piece, with Pbindef's in SuperCollider being generated by another piece of SC code and programatically 'typed' onto the screen, leaving David free to add in a solo part on electric guitar. On day two, he talked us through a stimulating range of [people, ideas and references](http://ow.ly/i/68GoK) as a follow up.
- [Andrew R Brown](http://andrewrbrown.net.au) talking about a spectrum of approaches to controlling algorithms, from text to gestural controllers, and points in between: also a nice demonstration of his own rig, using [impromputu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au/) combined with a simple bank of sliders and switches on an iPad mini.
- [Alex McLean](http://yaxu.org/) shared some of his work in collaboration with dancer [Kate Sicchio](https://www.sicchio.com/).
- [Andrew Duff](http://andrew-duff.co.uk/) gave a lively and fun talk/demo on the modular synth scene, liberally illustrated by [humorous](http://i.imgflip.com/2au6e.jpg) [gifs](http://i.imgflip.com/2dvei.jpg) from the [Muff Wiggler forums](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/). A lot of gear porn here, really, including mention of the [Pismo](http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/js_desk.png?w=630): ok, that's it, I'm hanging on to mine, one day I'll get it up and running again!
- [Cecile Chevalier](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p235751-cecile-chevalier) drew some comparisons between livecoding and the work of Jackson Pollock, although as we unpicked that, perhaps a slightly problematic parallel…

Overall, a very pleasant long weekend in the very pleasant seaside town of Brighton. The Sussex University campus was very comfortable, as was the wonderful [Dutch bike](https://plus.google.com/112046500604767220080/posts/YxUFef2fg3J) I hired from [Amsterdammers](http://brightoncyclehire.co.uk/).

Other things I learned about:

- the [empyre](http://empyre.library.cornell.edu/) mailing list
- [http://openendedgroup.com/field/](http://openendedgroup.com/field/)
- IOhannes Zmoelnig's attempts to [livecode Pd in Braille](https://vimeo.com/55085462)
- Marije's piece '[Code Live Code Live](https://www.marijebaalman.eu/?p=16)', livecoding the sound of typing

Final braindump, below an archive of all the #lcatb tweets (some of the attributions here probably wrong, collected this list in a rather hacky way…):
