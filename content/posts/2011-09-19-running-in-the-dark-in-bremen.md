Just found out that the Bremen gamelan group [Gamelan Kancil](http://www.arumsih.de/gamelan-kancil.htm "http://www.arumsih.de/gamelan-kancil.htm") are playing [Running in the Dark](http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/works/running/ "Running in the Dark") on Nov 27, working from the score they found here. Hope they make a recording, be curious to see what they make of it…
