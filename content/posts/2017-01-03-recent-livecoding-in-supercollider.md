Over the winter break I've been spending some time working on my livecoding/algorave setup in [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/). Here's a quick practice run, this is how things are going at the moment.

The most recent idea here is the \\warp synth, a granulator slowly reading through a choice of soundfiles. In this particular run, I think the .choose threw up a fragment of a Stokowski Bach transcription [https://archive.org/details/J.S.BACH-OrchestralTranscriptions-NEWTRANSFER](https://archive.org/details/J.S.BACH-OrchestralTranscriptions-NEWTRANSFER) and perhaps a bit of the theme tune from [The IT Crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C1WB38Dei4) as well. A nice background wash of sound behind the rhythmic stuff. For the latter, the samples in the first half of the video are various from here [http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/](http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/) and in the second half of the run, after I exectue ~changesamples, from here [http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html) and here [http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound\_samples](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples).

The synths I'm using and my initialisation file is up on GitHub at [https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/supercollider](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/supercollider).
