I'm working on a new piece towards [ARTMUSFAIR/2009](http://www.artmusfair.eu/2009/), for flute, horn, cello, marimba and 'tape'; this is me working towards the latter, the fixed audio part of the piece. Up to my usual text-to-screech tricks here; this shows some of the tools and methods I use to put things like this together.
