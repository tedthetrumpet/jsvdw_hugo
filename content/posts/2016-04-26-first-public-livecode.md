Last night I stumbled into my first public outing of some livecoding I've been working on in [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/). The context was an improvisation night called [In Tandem](https://www.facebook.com/events/1081102458615158/) run by [Bruce Wallace](http://cargocollective.com/whatitisis/about-what-it-is-is) at the [Academy of Music and Sound](http://academyofmusic.ac.uk/) in Glasgow. I hadn't intended to play, as I really don't feel I'm ready yet, but I had my laptop and cables with me, they had a projector, so…!

I was jamming along with three other people, on bass, guitar and analog synth. It all went by in a blur, but everyone there seemed to think what I was doing was ok – mostly making grooves out of a random collection of drum samples, but running some algorithmically chosen chords as well.

The code is below: this is my screen exactly as I left it at the end of the night, mistakes and all. Although [Toplap](http://toplap.org/wiki/Main_Page) say 'show us your screens', they don't say 'show us your code', but… it seems the right thing to do.
