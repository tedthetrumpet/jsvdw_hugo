<p>I’ve been calling myself a ‘composer’ for about twenty years now, starting from when I went back to music college as a trumpet player but got sidetracked into writing music instead of playing it. On my website you’ll find early pieces like ‘<a href="http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/works/rate/" title="Rate-limiting Step">Rate-limiting Step’</a> for cello &amp; harp, or ‘<a href="http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/works/nucleate/" title="Studies of Nucleate Boiling in Thin Liquid Layers">Studies of Nucleate Boiling in Thin Liquid Layers (Part 1)</a>’ for chamber ensemble. This is what people usually think of when I say I’m a ‘composer’: someone who writes contemporary score-based music for classically trained instrumentalists to play.</p>
<p>Yes, I’ve done a lot of that: but over the years it’s come to seem less and less interesting to me. For a number of years now, I’ve been working in a way which is much more akin to devised theatre, or even performance art. For a start, I hardly ever write the music down now, or if I do, it’s just fragments, starting points. By convention, a contemporary classical composer is expected to put <em>everything</em> in the score: the written score <em>is</em> the piece of music. You could post it off to an ensemble anywhere from Albuquerque to Zhytomyr, turn up a week later, and boom, there’s the piece being played.</p>
<p>Or at least, that’s the theory. But, take the very first work in my catalog, ‘<a href="http://jsimonvanderwalt.com/works/knowing/" title="The Knowing of Things Together">The Knowing of Things Together’</a>. It’s ‘scored’ for didjeridu, three flutes, three trombones, conga drums &amp; two wine bottles (red). Already, there’s a problem: that’s not a standard ensemble! So, actually, no-one is <em>ever</em> going to play this piece, apart from the people I was working with back then. So, really, the music is what the musicians and I actually did on that occasion, rather than anything I might write down.</p>
<p>Fast forward. The piece that’s about to come to fruition, ‘<a href="http://www.cryptic.org.uk/why-scotlandwhy-east-kilbride/">Why Scotland, Why East Kilbride</a>’, started life as a dream. This happens to me a lot: I’m a musician, after all, and I have dreams where I hear a piece of music. Quite often when I wake up I can remember at least some of it: I rush to write it down or even just sing it into my phone before it goes.</p>
<p>The piece I heard on this occasion – it was the morning of the 3 June 2012 – seemed to be for… a rock band? Plus a section of orchestral French horns?!?</p>
<p>Made some notes, forgot about it. Couple of days later, aimlessly surfing around as you do, I stumbled upon this <a href="http://ssa.nls.uk/film.cfm?fid=0955">1972 public information film</a> about East Kilbride. Suddenly a whole chunk of memory descended upon me. I remembered the two different times in my life when I lived in East Kilbride, particularly a period in the eary 80s where I was busy dropping out of an ill-advised science degree at university, listening to a lot of Hawkwind, and teaching myself to play guitar. Suddenly, the dream made sense: I knew what I was listening to, I knew what it was all about.</p>
<p>And the Ted Edwards stuff? A misdirection, perhaps. Edward ‘Teddy’ Edwards is a fictional alter ego of mine. He’s the person I would have liked to have been if I’d been born forty years earlier: he’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Scott">Raymond Scott</a>, he’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Oram">Daphne Oram</a>, he’s my dad’s golfing buddy who owned a radio shop, he’s Erik Satie. Or maybe he’s a complete unknown: he’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Elman">Ziggy Elman</a>, he’s the guy who first came up with the npn-pnp astable multivibrator circuit, he’s some guy who’s into birdwatching.</p>
<p>He’s a useful vehicle: someone I can have in my show, someone who might have been in East Kilbride in 1972, might have played in a rock band, might have had a day job as a chemist at the National Engineering Laboratory. Someone who might, after all, be a composer.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
