<p>Today&rsquo;s conference activities were somewhat disrupted by a revised schedule of wayang rehersals, which also caused our Scottish group a certain amount of last minute phone calls to try to get everyone there in time. I was fortunately able to make <a href="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/faculties/alss/deps/mpa/staff/helen_loth.html">Helen Loth&rsquo;s</a> paper session &lsquo;&ldquo;Why gamelan, couldn&rsquo;t we just use steel-pans?&rdquo;: The use of gamelan with special needs groups and populations&rsquo;. Helen is engaged on doctoral research in this area, and presented an illuminating account of her findings so far. Her application of the term &lsquo;special needs groups&rsquo; is very broad: in effect she is surveying pretty much the a full range of what I would might have called &lsquo;community music&rsquo; with gamelan in the UK. After a literature review, she presented a series of tables full of interesting nuggets of information: for instance, the most common timescale for this kind of work seems to be the (often criticised) one-off workshop, followed by the 1-2 week residency. I was particularly interested in a diagram which laid out people&rsquo;s perceived feelings about the different tunings one could potentialy use, slendro, pelog, Sundanese and two Balinese tunings. I was also fascinated by some of the negative perceptions of gamelan music which she had identified in her study. With the rescheduled day there was little time for discussion: this would have been an interesting area to probe further.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now been to two really excellent workshops by <a href="http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/gamelan-at-southbank-centre/learn-to-play/gamelan-tutors">Jonathan Roberts</a>. <a href="http://theplugboard.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/gamelan-weekend-at-rncm-sunday.html">A number of years ago</a> I participated in an illuminating session on wayang puppets and puppetry, and this morning he gave us a great section on gerongan, the unison (mostly male) singing which accompanies Javanese gamelan. In a brave but completely correct move, I think, Jonathan had us do hardly any singing, but spent the majority of the time on Javanese pronunciation. There are a number of sounds in the language which are not found in English, which we worked through in some detail: at times the session almost turned into – bilabial fricative?! – a lecture on phonetics. I still struggle to hear the difference between those d and t sounds, but I think I have clearer idea how to make them.</p>
<p>After the pronunciation, Jonathan took us through some techniques in Javanese vocal production. He started off by busting the myth that it is &rsquo;nasal&rsquo;. Instead, we were to try yawning, to start to feel the action of the pharynx and how that could be brought into action to produce a kind of vocal resonance which he called &rsquo;twang&rsquo;. I can&rsquo;t do it yet, but at least I&rsquo;m going to stop singing through my nose!</p>
