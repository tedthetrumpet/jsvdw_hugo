    <p><p>This is the sort of thing where there&rsquo;s probably a video out there already explaining it, but as I ended up figuring it out myself anyway, I thought I might as well make my own video… This is how to send midi information from Max/MSP to Logic Pro, in particular how to use Max to control the automation parameters of a softsynth running in Logic. Probably best to watch these fullscreeen; <a href="http://youtu.be/8nHpYZkgi1A">http://youtu.be/8nHpYZkgi1A</a> <a href="http://youtu.be/mA3-vTIpkXQ">http://youtu.be/mA3-vTIpkXQ</a></p>

    <p><p><a href="http://www.artmusfair.eu/2009/">ARTMUSFAIR</a> is… well, I guess you could describe it as a trade fair for contemporary music (stop giggling) which this year is happening in Glasgow, Thur 29 Oct to Sun 1 Nov. I&rsquo;ve got two things confirmed and a third in the pipeline.</p>
<p>First up is a new piece certain assumptions, which was accepted in a call for scores by the Red Note Ensemble. It&rsquo;s for alto flute, horn, marimba, cello and &rsquo;tape&rsquo;, with the latter part composed using a patch I made at the pd bootcamp in Wales <a href="http://jsimonvanderwalt.blogspot.com/2009/09/pd-bootcamp-at-rwcmd.html">earlier this year</a>. Here&rsquo;s the &lsquo;programme note&rsquo;;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;When you go to the doctor you assume that he will care for you in his normal compassionate way, ultimately finding the solution to your ailments. Why else would you go?</p>
<p>On your last trip to the grocery store did you assume the food was free from bacteria? I bet you did, otherwise you would find somewhere else to shop; that is if you lived through the bacterial infection.</p>
<p>As you can see sometimes assumptions help us relieve potential anxiety. They can be very useful ways of diverting stress but unfortunately even the white knight puts on a black hat once in a while.&rsquo; (<a href="http://bit.ly/LFxW8%29">http://bit.ly/LFxW8)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the information I have &rsquo;the performance is scheduled to begin at 10:30pm on 30th October 2009, in the bar attached to the Millennium Hotel on George Square, Glasgow. The performance will be informal, amplified and compered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, on the Saturday morning at about 0900 we are planning a performance of <a href="http://www.jsimonvanderwalt.com/catalog/circular.html">CIRCULARTHING</a> and other works by the long-lost Society for High Art Music. To complete a trilogy of van der Walt, I&rsquo;m also trying to persuade them to let me give the first performance of my soon-to-be-notorious &lsquo;Music Is Not Sound&rsquo; lecture.</p>

    </h2>

    <p><p>A long-standing frustration of mine is the way the music notation package Sibelius handles the &rsquo;tilde&rsquo; sign ~ in text. As a sort of clever bodge or hack, it is used to hide midi messages, so that a control change for example can be put in the score as &lsquo;~C64,127&rsquo;, but won&rsquo;t print out.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m of the frequent habit of using the ~ sign to mean &lsquo;approximately&rsquo;; I&rsquo;d love to be able to mark a pause, for instance as &lsquo;~45 seconds&rsquo;, meaning roughly 45 seconds, but when you do that the text gets hidden.</p>
<p>Today I thought I&rsquo;d found a hack for the hack, a workaround for the workaround. In the character palette on the mac, I found something called the &rsquo;tilde operator&rsquo; character under the maths category which looks exactly the same, but as it isn&rsquo;t an ascii tilde, Sibelius doesn&rsquo;t hide the text; <a href="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/cpallete.png"><img src="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/cpallete.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>However, something else kind of strange happens. When I&rsquo;m editing the text string in Sibelius the character seems to display correctly, but when I come out of edit mode it gets displayed as a grey box; <a href="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/edit.png"><img src="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/edit.png?w=286" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/enter.png"><img src="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/enter.png?w=257" alt="" /></a> So, still impossible to use a ~ character in text anywhere in Sibelius without the text being hidden. How frustrating.</p>
<p>Update</p>
<p>Following some helpful remarks on the Yahoo! Sibelius group and in my blog comments, this has been cleared up a bit. The ~ character isn&rsquo;t in the Arial font, but inserting it as Symbol font works fine; this seems to kind of happen automagically in Word and Pages and not Sibelius, but that&rsquo;s fine and easy to fix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been a suggestion that I shouldn&rsquo;t use this symbol as it wouldn&rsquo;t be clear to musicians. On looking into this is discover that ~ as an abbreviation for &lsquo;approximately&rsquo; is not as widespread as I thought it was, although for me it&rsquo;s an everyday thing. Oh well; being unclear to musicians is all part of the game anyway.</p>

    <p><p>All week I&rsquo;ve been on a PureData course at the <a href="http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/">Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama</a>, with Simon Kilshaw. <a href="https://puredata.info/">PureData</a>, or Pd, is a free and open source graphical programming language for music and video; in plain language, a system allows one to plug together a series of graphical objects on a screen in order to create an original work of digital art.</p>
<p>Pd is closely allied with another very similar language, <a href="http://cycling74.com/products/max5">Max/MSP</a>, both having in fact been initiated by the same programmer, <a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/%7Emsp/">Miller Puckette</a>. I&rsquo;ve been working with and teaching a Max/MSP course for several years now; so why study Pd? Max/MSP is in many ways a much slicker and more fully developed environment, significantly easier to use, with clear documentation and tutorials, many higher level objects built in, and a large community of users. By contrast, coming to Pd from Max feels like a step back in time; the user interface seems clunky, many basic objects seem to be missing, the documentation is by comparison chaotic, and overall it feels like a poor relation.</p>
<p>Well, poor; yes exactly! You would be if you had to buy Max/MSP at the full commercial going rate of $699, and the &lsquo;price point&rsquo; of Pd is undoubtably a serious attraction. More importantly, perhaps, the open source nature of Pd creates a different kind of community, one where it is perhaps easier for creative artists to own and share their digital works without being encumbered by licencing considerations.</p>
<p>The course here has been quite a full-on experience. Simon and his students at RWCMD seem to have a programming style which is extremely fast and hacky, driving straight at getting musical results from the software without much concern for neatness or elegance. It works; most of the week we&rsquo;ve been following along behind Simon click-by-click as he more or less improvised patches before our eyes. Graphical languages are great for this kind of very rapid prototyping and developing of ideas, although I found that for my style of working I liked to go a little bit slower and think through what I was doing a little more.</p>
<p>Over the last two days we&rsquo;ve also seen some of the work of one of the graduates here, Tristan Evans, including a very impressive piece for piano and Pd called &lsquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN06Ipq7ldk">Takeover</a>&rsquo;. Tomorrow, we&rsquo;re scheduled to put together a collaborative performance using a rather remarkable internet-based version of Pd, <a href="http://netpd.org/">netpd</a>; if all goes according to plan you should be able to watch and hear us all performing live using <a href="rtsp://194.82.127.93/mystream.sdp">this url</a> at 1500 GMT+1 (that&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock UK time).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll (maybe) be performing on the patch above. For those who are interested, this uses nothing which is not in Pd-extended (I hope!). The guts of the sound are four Karplus-Strong &lsquo;pluck&rsquo; synths, with the delay lengths changing at random to produce glissando effects. These gestures are fed into an instance of freeverb, where the reverb tail can be frozen; while the tail is frozen, a pitch shifter patch is used to move this sound around in interesting ways. The klang gestures are either triggered manually, or by a randomised metronome, which can be set to the rather ridiculous value of 25 ms to produce an insane cascade of stringy sounds.</p>

    <p><p>This years Plug 2009 festival of new music at the RSAMD starts soon, 27 April - 1 May. One of the features this year is a new set of &lsquo;Glasgow&rsquo; sequenzas, written variously by students and staff and interspersed among larger programme items. Mine is for trombone and, between myself and Head of Composition Gordon McPherson, we&rsquo;ve cooked up a plan to, um, kill a trombonist? Here&rsquo;s my description from the score;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Over the course of an extended period of time (30-60 minutes) the trombonist is asked to play a &lsquo;virtuosic&rsquo; passage in alternation with vigorous bouts of physical exercise. The piece becomes harder to execute as it progresses; not through any development in the music, but through the physical deterioration of the player. At intervals during the performance we hear a tireless computer rendition of the piece as it &lsquo;ought&rsquo; to be.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got Davur Magnussen, the brilliant new young principal trombone of the <a href="http://www.rsno.org.uk/">RSNO</a> running on a treadmill over the course of an hour, whilst attempting to play &lsquo;virtuosic&rsquo; material of one sort or another in competition with the computer. Should be fun! (Well, not so much fun for Davur, perhaps :) <a href="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/exercise_ex.png"><img src="http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/exercise_ex.png?w=300" alt="" /></a> Draft version of the score <a href="https://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/exercise_d3.pdf">available</a> as pdf.</p>

    <p><p>I&rsquo;m quite excited today to discover a free/open-source music notation program I hadn&rsquo;t previously heard of, <a href="http://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a>. (That I hadn&rsquo;t heard of it probably has something to do with the fact that they&rsquo;ve only just released a mac binary.) Very early days so far, but already I&rsquo;m very excited to see the beginnings of what could be a foss alternative to Sibelius and Finale, something which I think the world badly needs. I had a play with it; it&rsquo;s ok, got used to the note entry and editing interface quite quickly, kind of like a cross between Sib and Fin in the way it works. Didn&rsquo;t take long to notate the gamelan tune I heard in my dream this morning, although I could have done with a custom key signature;</p>

<p>I was able to export it as a midi file, which had some small problems, and also as .xml which, again after a bit of hacking I was able to open very nicely in Sibelius. Now, if I was dead pure rich and that, I&rsquo;d give these guys a bunch of money to really develop this!</p>
