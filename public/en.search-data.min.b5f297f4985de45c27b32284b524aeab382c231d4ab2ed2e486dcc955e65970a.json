Never mind technical shortcomings, rough edges, the fractured tenor who was clearly in discomfort. Last night\u0026rsquo;s offering by RSAMD students in the academy\u0026rsquo;s festival of new music, Plug, gets five stars for the originality of creative thought that flowed from student composers Simon van der Walt and Gareth Williams into two new works for theatrical performance.\nIn another era, van der Walt\u0026rsquo;s Schaduwee would have been called a song cycle. This creation, for soprano, four bassoons, piano, electronics, kazoo, projected images and some horseplay (I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen the pianist hilariously heave out the innards of a prepared piano as part of a piece) was something else, though there were enough Malherian devices to give a hook into the familiar. The piece, a musical, literary and theatrical questioning of language, was abundant with ideas, arcane and mundane, but was dazzlingly performed by stratospheric soprano Alexa Mason and her team of intrumentalists.\nGareth Williams\u0026rsquo; one-act boxing opera, Love in the Blue Corner, is like nothing else I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a theatre. It turns its subject inside out. There is only one boxer. He\u0026rsquo;s a loser and he dies, beaten to a pulp. He stands, silent and still in the read-lit centre of the ring, while a make-up artist daubs him with the sweat, bruises, cuts, fractures and wounds that leave him wrecked. The action of the match is in Williams\u0026rsquo;s postminimalist, postmodern music, belted out by the ensemble, and given voice by the trainer, who exhorts his stubborn failure of a protege to move, jab, dance, persist.\nIt was a heartbreaking tragedy in a mind expanding night from the students.\u0026rsquo;\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/assessment/","title":"Assessment","section":"Docs","content":" Assessment # Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning, forming part of the cycle of performance, evaluation, and reflection that underpins your artistic development. It is also the mechanism which allows for a judgement as to whether you have completed the requirements of the programme, and, in the case of modules which carry a grade, to what standard. Assessment involves gathering, measuring and judging information about your progress.\nEach module in the programme states learning outcomes, describing the knowledge, skills and understanding that must be demonstrated in order to pass the module. Each learning outcome is accompanied by assessment criteria, that indicate the factors which examiners will look for in order to determine whether a learning outcome has been met. The quality of the work is judged against an assessment matrix (or \u0026lsquo;rubric\u0026rsquo;), which, in conjunction with the professional experience of the examiner, is used to determine whether the work is a pass or a fail and, in the case of assessments that carry a grade, to calibrate the level of the achievement according to the common assessment scale.\nThe module descriptor states the types of assessment that will be used: for most strands in the programme, a range of options are offered in the principal study assessment specifications. In cases where there is more than one graded assessment a weighting is assigned to each in order to calculate an overall module grade. All learning outcomes must be met in order to pass a module, and all summative assessments must be passed in order to pass a module.\nAlthough the overall degree carries no classification, grades for the Principal Study module will appear on your transcript, offering evidence to other educational institutions and potential employers of the level of your achievement.\nAssessment modes # Module Mode of Assessment Outcome Principal Study Performance Graded Supporting Studies Observation of Working Practice Pass/Fail Practice Research Portfolio Pass/Fail Role Study Critical Portfolio Pass/Fail Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy Essay, Observation of Working Practice Graded Negotiated Study Negotiated (eg Performance, Portfolio, Dissertation) Graded HIPP Dissertation Dissertation Graded Options Variable Variable Submissions of written work through moodle are marked anonymously: however, there is nothing to prevent you from putting your name on the work should you wish.\nWith certain exceptions, Principal Study live in-person A assessments are externally assessed with a public audience. B assessments are usually internally assessed and non-public but may exceptionally be made public by prior agreement with the Head of Department.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, bespoke alternative assessments may be replace those given in the Assessment Specifications. Alternative assessments must be clearly negotiated between the Head of Department, Head of Programme and the student, and should also be approved by the Director of Music. The replacement assessment must demonstrably meet the learning outcomes of the module and be commensurate in terms of the volume and level of challenge. The requirements of the assessment should be clearly noted on the student contract, including agreement as appropriate around aspects such as the length, repertoire, scheduling, timing and/or format of the alternative submission/performance.\nFeedback on assessment # Feedback is central to learning: its nature and purpose is related to the two main types of assessment, formative and summative:\nFormative assessment is concerned with your development during the course of learning: it informs you about your progress. In the MMus/MA, particular emphasis is placed on written formative assessment within the Supporting Studies module. Summative assessment usually takes place at the end of a programme of work and, in the MMus/MA, often takes the form of a performance, portfolio, or other culmination of learning. It sums up your achievement, providing a clear statement of success or failure in meeting the learning outcomes of the module. Feedback is inherent to both types of assessment. It may take many forms:\nVerbal, on an instantaneous basis, such as the formative feedback you receive every week in the Principal Study lesson or in a tutorial with your Head of Department. Written, as a comment on a performance, portfolio submission, or other summative outcome: you can expect detailed written feedback on all major summative assessments. Mutually Constructed, where feedback is written collaboratively by you and the tutor: this is used in many departments as an element of Supporting Studies. Grades are also a form of feedback, including the formative process grades given for Supporting Studies and the summative grades offered in the Principal Study. For practical reasons, summative written feedback on assessments may be returned to students either through the student contract, through moodle or by email. Final ratified grades do not appear on the student contract until after the relevant exam board.\nAssessment scale # Assessment is recorded using the Conservatoire\u0026rsquo;s Common Assessment Scale. The outcome of a module may either be noted as Pass/Fail, or graded alphanumerically:\nCommon Assessment Scale Descriptor A1 Excellent A2 Excellent A3 Excellent A4 Excellent A5 Excellent B1 Very Good B2 Very Good B3 Very Good C1 Good C2 Good C3 Good D1 Satisfactory D2 Satisfactory D3 Adequate PASS FAIL E1 Inadequate/Fail E2 Inadequate/Fail F Serious fail NS Non-submission/Non-appearance Assessment regulations # Repetition of repertoire # Repertoire cannot normally be repeated across assessments unless there is a clear rationale negotiated and agreed with the Head of Department.\nPlagiarism and academic misconduct # Academic misconduct includes cheating, collusion, and plagiarism. Essentially, all work submitted for assessment should be yours except in cases where group work is a specific requirement of an assignment.\nPlagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct are serious disciplinary matters that will incur a £125 financial penalty. Further strictures may include:\nhaving to resit an assessment having to resit the module having to retake a year of study having to leave the Conservatoire Further information, including the mechanism for appeal, may be found in the Conservatoire\u0026rsquo;s Regulations, Codes of Procedure and General Rules.\nNon-submission # Resits due to non-submission or non-attendance will be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module. Resits due to cheating or plagiarism shall also be subject to a fee of £125 per component per resit within a module.\nGraduation costs # There is no fee to graduate and attend the Graduation Ceremony. However, there is a fee to hire a gown which is compulsory. A fee of approximately £50 is payable to an external gown supplier and you will be advised of how to do this as part of the graduation registration process.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/attendance/","title":"Attendance","section":"Docs","content":" Attendance # You are expected to attend all classes and rehearsals. Poor attendance and/or poor timekeeping will have a detrimental impact on your learning and the learning of other students. It can also lead to disciplinary action in line with the Conservatoire\u0026rsquo;s Rules and Regulations.\nIllness # Unforeseen absence due to illness should be logged on Asimut no later than 9:30am. You must not declare illness unless you are actually ill.\nIf you are involved in a large ensemble activity that day then you should:\ndeclare illness on Asimut and contact the Orchestral Manager, Gemma Carlin, by email (g.carlin@rcs.ac.uk) or telephone (0141 270 8240) and inform your Head of Department If you are absent from classes due to illness for five consecutive weekdays then on your return you must submit a medical certificate to the AAS Office.\nIf you are absent from an assessment or unable to submit coursework on time due to illness then you should email the relevant Programme or Departmental PSA. In addition, to avoid a penalty you should submit a PMC (Personal Mitigating Circumstances) form with a medical certificate. The PMC form can be found on the landing page when you sign in to your Student Contract.\nAbsence Requests # Pre-arranged absence for attending external activities, for instance a scheduled medical appointment or external concert engagement, should be requested at least seven days in advance using the absence request form on your Student Contract. You must use this system to request absence: it is not sufficient to speak informally to a member of staff about the request.\nWe strongly advise that you apply for authorised absence for all term-time external engagements, even if you have no Conservatoire activities listed in your Asimut timetable at the time of checking. Classes and rehearsals may change, and practical assessments may not be confirmed until three weeks before the exam. If your absence request has been approved, then we will not schedule any activities or assessments during that time.\nIt is your responsibility to list all affected classes, activities and assessments on the absence request form. Once the request is reviewed, your Head of Programme and Head of Department will make a decision on the outcome (approved, conditionally approved or rejected), which is then posted on your Student Contract. Not all requests will be approved, especially if assessments would be affected by the absence. For this reason, you should not make any travel plans until you have received written notification that your request has been approved.\nUnauthorised Absence # Continued unauthorised absence, including unexplained illness, will have a detrimental impact on your learning and may result in investigation and disciplinary action.\nIn line with the Conservatoire\u0026rsquo;s Rules and Regulations, students who fail to meet attendance requirements and who fail to respond positively to written warnings on the matter may lose the right to present for examination. In this case you will not be permitted to submit work or attend the examination and the outcome will be recorded as a fail.\nExtension Requests # It is expected that you will manage your time to ensure that all assessment deadlines are met. Work submitted late will not be accepted, resulting in the assessment being failed due to non-submission. You will also incur the associated financial penalty of £125 per assessment.\nThe following are examples of circumstances which the Conservatoire would expect you to manage:\nminor illness or ailment (unless they resulted in you being unable to perform); personal/domestic events that could have been planned for; choices in personal life (eg attending weddings, holidays etc); transport or travel problems (unless caused by a recorded local/national crisis or a natural disaster); failure or theft of your computer or other equipment being used to produce the work to be assessed, including work not being backed-up; programme demands or misunderstanding of deadlines/dates (including failure of thers to submit group assignments). If you know in advance that you will be unable to meet the submission deadline through good cause, you may apply for an extension to the deadline, using an Extension Request Form. Extensions should normally be requested a minimum of 48 hours in advance of the deadline. Extensions are usually only granted for 1 or 2 working days, exceptionally for a maximum of 7 calendar days.\nPersonal Mitigating Circumstances # Where a significant and unexpected circumstance beyond your control has affected your studies and temporarily prevents you from undertaking an assessment or significantly impairs your performance in an assessment, you may submit a Personal Mitigating Circumstances Form. The following are examples of circumstances that would be considered as mitigating circumstances:\nserious or incapacitating injury, illness or medical condition or emergency operation. a significant family or personal crisis (eg bereavement or a serious illness affecting a close family member). unforeseen, unpreventable events (eg being a victim of a criminal act, natural disaster, including severe weather affecting travel). The Extension Request form and Personal Mitigating Circumstances form can be found on the Student Portal.\nTimetabling of Music Ensembles # Many of the ensemble activities within the School of Music are too complex to be captured in detail using Asimut. These are instead timetabled by the Music Ensembles Manager, including:\nSymphony Orchestra Chamber Orchestra Wind Orchestra Opera Orchestra MusicLab Contemporary Ensembles involved in the Plug Festival Jazz Orchestra Ballet Orchestra Musical Theatre Pit Orchestras and Pit Bands Conductors Ensemble Repertoire Orchestra Asimut should only be used as a guide with regards to these rehearsals. The main point of reference is the Orchestra and Ensembles folder on One Drive. The link to this will be sent to you via email and you can save this to your favourites to reference daily. If you are involved in any activity, you should carefully take down all rehearsal and performance details in your diary. It is compulsory that you attend all rehearsals. If you do not come to a rehearsal because it isn\u0026rsquo;t on Asimut, but is on One Drive, that will not be accepted as an authorised absence.\nMusic Ensembles Manager # Gemma Carlin Room: 2.23 Email: g.carlin@rcs.ac.uk Office Phone: 0141 270 8240 "},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/example/collapsed/3rd-level/4th-level/","title":"4th Level","section":"3rd Level","content":" 4th Level of Menu # Caesorum illa tu sentit micat vestes papyriferi # Inde aderam facti; Theseus vis de tauri illa peream.
