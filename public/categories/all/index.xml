      <title>Not algorave</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in now taking the SuperCollider livecoding techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve developed in the context of algorave and applying them to the creation of fixed media sound works. Here is one, using some prepared piano samples that Dr Kurt James Werner has been kind enough to put online.&#xA;[audio src=&amp;ldquo;https://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pylon-country.mp3&#34;][/audio]&#xA;pylon-country.mp3&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect: there is still a strong element of improvisation in this way of working, and there are places in this track where, on listening back, I might have wished to have performed differently.</description>

      <description>As part of the team that organised the third METRIC Improvisation Intensive at the Royal Conservatoire of Glasgow, I did not have as much time as I might have liked to improvise myself. I was pleased however to be joined for an impromptu livecoded session by Anne-Liis Poll, Professor of Improvisation at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre:&#xA;[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjlTZuKa7iw?rel=0]&#xA;This did not quite turn out the way I had intended!</description>

      <description>My institution, The Royal Conservatoire of Glasgow, have sent me on a trip to make connections with a number of potential partners in Indonesia, including the UPH Conservatory of Music, the Jakarta Institute of Arts (IKJ), and Institut Seni Indonesia Surakarta (ISI Solo). I&amp;rsquo;ll also be visiting Singapore to see Setan Jawa, and talk to the producers about bringing this to Glasgow for a Festival of Gamelan and the Moving Image that we are planning here for September.</description>

      <description>Next Friday I’m going to to be taking part in a 24 hour online algorave event wearefive to celebrate five years of the algorave movement. By accident or design I’m on back to back with coï¿¥ï¾¡pt (aka Sean Cotterill) who is one of only a couple of us livecoding in pure SuperCollider, rather than the by-now overwelmingly popular TidalCycles.&#xA;Sean has been putting together an interesting set of pages on his approach to livecoding in SC, particularly on the things that need to be set up beforehand.</description>

      <description>Over the winter break I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time working on my livecoding/algorave setup in SuperCollider. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick practice run, this is how things are going at the moment.&#xA;https://youtu.be/nk58NBtMFvE&#xA;The most recent idea here is the \warp synth, a granulator slowly reading through a choice of soundfiles. In this particular run, I think the .choose threw up a fragment of a Stokowski Bach transcription https://archive.org/details/J.S.BACH-OrchestralTranscriptions-NEWTRANSFER and perhaps a bit of the theme tune from The IT Crowd as well.</description>

      <description>When I was at emfcamp last week, I saw a couple of instances of people layering up visuals with their code. Claudius Maximus had that going with his clive system, SonicPi (and Gibber??) can do it out of the box, and Shelly Knotts had some sort of setup for (I think?) doing it completely within SuperCollider, with the cool idea of a webcam pointing down at her hands on the keyboard.</description>

      <description>Show us your screens! Ok, well at last maybe I&amp;rsquo;m ready. Here&amp;rsquo;s five minutes or so of me improvising in SuperCollider that&amp;rsquo;s not as embarrassing as some of my other attempts:&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhprsv_c27o&#xA;The code is on GitHub if anyone is madly interested.</description>

      <description>[soundcloud url=&amp;ldquo;http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/30240394&#34;]&#xA;Not be much to listen to, maybe, but feels an important moment for me: a new direction after finishing the PhD, satisfyingly far away from score-based contemporary &amp;lsquo;classical&amp;rsquo; nonpop, or whatever you call all that stuff. Next up: more of this kind of thing, plus more gamelan. Happy days.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing, um, I guess my first ever solo electro-junk improv gig on Friday 5 December. Ulp. Here&amp;rsquo;s the poster… I&amp;rsquo;m almost embarrased to say:&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s see, the plan includes… a Pd patch running on the netbook, probably SuperCollider running on the (new secondhand) MacBook Pro. The Novation BassStation and the Hammond AutoVari 64, a mixing desk, and a pocket trumpet with a piezo mic inside a harmon mute. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with so far, anyway&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a piece for this year&amp;rsquo;s Plug festival at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which will be in May sometime. The theme this time round is &amp;lsquo;postludes&amp;rsquo;. Head of Composition Gordon McPherson has invited all the composers here, including staff like myself, to compose something which draws on, or reflects, or comments upon in some way, a piece from a previous Plug festival.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself drawn immediately to one of Gordon&amp;rsquo;s own pieces from 2007, &amp;lsquo;Spiricom&amp;rsquo;, part of a trilogy of pieces called &amp;lsquo;Ghosts&amp;rsquo; which deal in various ways with death and a possible afterlife.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just got a new toy (tx John!). It&amp;rsquo;s a Cheetah MQ8 midi sequencer. This is UK made, apparently released sometime in the late 80s as a competitor to the Alesis MMT-8. I&amp;rsquo;ve only just started to figure it out: pretty crazy trying to do everything with a combination of button presses and a tiny, dim LCD screen!&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a two track improvisation, using sounds from my trusty Casio GZ-50M.</description>

      <description>So here I am at the Forum for Innovation in Music Production and Composition at Leeds College of Music. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a conference, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into the swing of it. It&amp;rsquo;s hardly coalmining; nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s quite tiring to sit still all day listening to a long series of what can be quite dense and complicated presentations.&#xA;The subject matter for this conference at least is consistently up my street.</description>

      <description>The programme note for my latest piece Étude-Poème pour Pianiste Récitant, being performed this evening at 1830 by Silviya Mihaylova.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;So, here’s the idea; a piano étude where the pianist speaks to the audience, playing along with what she is saying. This idea has several things going for it, for one, hopefully nobody else will have hit on the selfsame thing. Also… here’s what it says in the Oxford Companion to Music, under ‘étude’;</description>

      <description>Having some free time over the Easter break, and in preparation for taking part in a performance of Cage&amp;rsquo;s Musicircus at Tramway on 30 May, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the Lexicon MPX 100 effects unit which Allan Neave gave me, feeding it back into itself, which works particularly nicely on the pitch-shift-plus-delay patches. At the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Max patch which drifts five-note chords gradually through a modulating set of hexatonic regions, so… without really meaning to, I ended up putting together a sort of ambient track combing the two;</description>

      <description>This is the sort of thing where there&amp;rsquo;s probably a video out there already explaining it, but as I ended up figuring it out myself anyway, I thought I might as well make my own video… This is how to send midi information from Max/MSP to Logic Pro, in particular how to use Max to control the automation parameters of a softsynth running in Logic. Probably best to watch these fullscreeen; http://youtu.</description>

      <description>ARTMUSFAIR is… well, I guess you could describe it as a trade fair for contemporary music (stop giggling) which this year is happening in Glasgow, Thur 29 Oct to Sun 1 Nov. I&amp;rsquo;ve got two things confirmed and a third in the pipeline.&#xA;First up is a new piece certain assumptions, which was accepted in a call for scores by the Red Note Ensemble. It&amp;rsquo;s for alto flute, horn, marimba, cello and &amp;rsquo;tape&amp;rsquo;, with the latter part composed using a patch I made at the pd bootcamp in Wales earlier this year.</description>

      <description>A long-standing frustration of mine is the way the music notation package Sibelius handles the &amp;rsquo;tilde&amp;rsquo; sign ~ in text. As a sort of clever bodge or hack, it is used to hide midi messages, so that a control change for example can be put in the score as &amp;lsquo;~C64,127&amp;rsquo;, but won&amp;rsquo;t print out.&#xA;However, I&amp;rsquo;m of the frequent habit of using the ~ sign to mean &amp;lsquo;approximately&amp;rsquo;; I&amp;rsquo;d love to be able to mark a pause, for instance as &amp;lsquo;~45 seconds&amp;rsquo;, meaning roughly 45 seconds, but when you do that the text gets hidden.</description>

      <description>All week I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a PureData course at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, with Simon Kilshaw. PureData, or Pd, is a free and open source graphical programming language for music and video; in plain language, a system allows one to plug together a series of graphical objects on a screen in order to create an original work of digital art.&#xA;Pd is closely allied with another very similar language, Max/MSP, both having in fact been initiated by the same programmer, Miller Puckette.</description>

      <description>This years Plug 2009 festival of new music at the RSAMD starts soon, 27 April - 1 May. One of the features this year is a new set of &amp;lsquo;Glasgow&amp;rsquo; sequenzas, written variously by students and staff and interspersed among larger programme items. Mine is for trombone and, between myself and Head of Composition Gordon McPherson, we&amp;rsquo;ve cooked up a plan to, um, kill a trombonist?

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited today to discover a free/open-source music notation program I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously heard of, MuseScore. (That I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of it probably has something to do with the fact that they&amp;rsquo;ve only just released a mac binary.) Very early days so far, but already I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to see the beginnings of what could be a foss alternative to Sibelius and Finale, something which I think the world badly needs.</description>

      <description>Nice piece on &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo; by Clare Sinclair in the Skinny;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The lines between technology and the arts are blurring at an astronomical pace: the latest laptops and computers position themselves not only as tools for business, but as home entertainment centres where anything seems possible.&#xA;J. Simon van der Walt, performing as part of the Cryptic Nights season, parallels this revolution yet takes it back to the &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo;. As Edward &amp;lsquo;Teddy&amp;rsquo; Edwards and the Electr-O-Chromatic orchestra, he presents and electronic symphony of music and performance.</description>

      <description>Got hold of a loan of a very cool instrument to use in the show;&#xA;Yup, it&amp;rsquo;s a cynthcart, a Commodore 64 hacked up to play as a synth! Tried it out in rehearsal today, works great. (Thanks to Col for the loan.)</description>

      <description>Well, that worked out easily enough. If the longer numbers are in the region of five mins, I reckon I can just about bring that in at 45 mins.&#xA;Also working on a list of instruments, looks like twenty-two different bits of gear, including laptops, effects units and conventional instruments.</description>

      <description>Driving work the other morning, I wrote this waltz in my head;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;lsquo;Slipping Away&amp;rsquo; because, as you might have noticed, each time it repeats it accidentally slides down a semitone; like the last slush of winter on a window pane, or someone slowly, gently, dying&amp;hellip;&#xA;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use it in the show on March 5th. Which now, finally has a fourth player! And, I got a loan the other day of an *extremely* cool instrument to use in the show, more details to follow.</description>

      <description>I was round at Eddie&amp;rsquo;s house the other day, and we had a go at circuit bending an old Yamaha RX17 drum machine;&#xA;This is pretty standard stuff, a well-known bend linking pins 4 and 12 of IC 116. After some experimentation, we decided on a 100k log pot with a 1k resistor in series. Ed is a bit iffy about the whole idea of circuit-bending, kind of goes against the grain for someone who was trained in electronic engineering!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to persuade Ted to let me post some of the amazing back catalog he&amp;rsquo;s built up over the years. Below is a piece called &amp;lsquo;slacion&amp;rsquo; which he did &amp;lsquo;sometime in the late 70s&amp;rsquo;, using an adapted version of the PE Minisonic synth plus tape loops plus a spring reverb. The video is also by Ted, a recent digital remix of &amp;lsquo;some old Betamax that&amp;rsquo;s up in the loft&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Hers is a very early and approximate proof-of-concept video of a possible text-to-screech interface for &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo;;&#xA;[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npii4-3awcQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0]&#xA;The idea is to have a laptop and screen onstage, visible to the audience. The setup is used by various performers during the piece, in various ways; to address the audience, or to direct an improvisation, ask questions, tell a story… anything, really.&#xA;&amp;rsquo;text-to-screech&amp;rsquo; is my coining for taking familiar text-to-speak technology built into many modern computers, and mangle it, creatively misuse it.</description>

      <description>The performance of The Whirlies the other night was a bit of a stunning success. Good audience, including the arts editor of the Herald, Keith Bruce, who seemed to really get the piece;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The new music came from J Simon van der Walt, whose The Whirlies pitted his own prepared multiphonic scrabbling with table-top banjo ukulele and electronic gizmos against lush concert-orchestra strings - a collision only enhanced by the shattering of a glass behind the bar.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m putting in a proposal to Cryptic Nights to do a show called, to give it its full title, Ted Edwards proudly presents Bare Wires - Live in concert or just Bare Wires for short. Below I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered together in one place some relevant video and other documentation;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The Other Other Hand&amp;rsquo; is pretty much fully documented from initial ideas to final performance at workingtitle08.blogspot.com - the best place to start is probably the three-minute preview video at the top of that page, also available on YouTube.</description>

      <description>I have a commission for another piece from the Scottish Philharmonic Orchestra, for a concert at Òran Mór in Glasgow on 17 November. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be called &amp;lsquo;The Whirlies&amp;rsquo;, which is a famous roundabout in East Kilbride; to be the first movement of a suite dedicated to the, er, roundabouts of East Kilbride!&#xA;The piece is essentially for strings, but - and I haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly told them this yet - I intend to turn up and do some live electro-junk impro along with the piece as well.</description>

      <description>Well, Gareth and I got a really excellent review for our concert last night from Michael Tumelty in the Glasgow Herald;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s not mess about. Never mind technical shortcomings, rough edges, the fractured tenor who was clearly in discomfort. Last night&amp;rsquo;s offering by RSAMD students in the academy&amp;rsquo;s festival of new music, Plug, gets five stars for the originality of creative thought that flowed from student composers Simon van der Walt and Gareth Williams into two new works for theatrical performance.</description>
