      <description>Nice piece on &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo; by Clare Sinclair in the Skinny;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The lines between technology and the arts are blurring at an astronomical pace: the latest laptops and computers position themselves not only as tools for business, but as home entertainment centres where anything seems possible.&#xA;J. Simon van der Walt, performing as part of the Cryptic Nights season, parallels this revolution yet takes it back to the &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo;. As Edward &amp;lsquo;Teddy&amp;rsquo; Edwards and the Electr-O-Chromatic orchestra, he presents and electronic symphony of music and performance.</description>

      <description>Got hold of a loan of a very cool instrument to use in the show;&#xA;Yup, it&amp;rsquo;s a cynthcart, a Commodore 64 hacked up to play as a synth! Tried it out in rehearsal today, works great. (Thanks to Col for the loan.)</description>

      <description>Well, that worked out easily enough. If the longer numbers are in the region of five mins, I reckon I can just about bring that in at 45 mins.&#xA;Also working on a list of instruments, looks like twenty-two different bits of gear, including laptops, effects units and conventional instruments.</description>

      <title>Slipping Away</title>

      <description>Driving work the other morning, I wrote this waltz in my head;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;lsquo;Slipping Away&amp;rsquo; because, as you might have noticed, each time it repeats it accidentally slides down a semitone; like the last slush of winter on a window pane, or someone slowly, gently, dying&amp;hellip;&#xA;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll use it in the show on March 5th. Which now, finally has a fourth player! And, I got a loan the other day of an *extremely* cool instrument to use in the show, more details to follow.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to persuade Ted to let me post some of the amazing back catalog he&amp;rsquo;s built up over the years. Below is a piece called &amp;lsquo;slacion&amp;rsquo; which he did &amp;lsquo;sometime in the late 70s&amp;rsquo;, using an adapted version of the PE Minisonic synth plus tape loops plus a spring reverb. The video is also by Ted, a recent digital remix of &amp;lsquo;some old Betamax that&amp;rsquo;s up in the loft&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Managing to do the same kind of thing now in SuperCollider, speaking one word at a time, which kind of makes more sense in this context; loudcoding?&#xA;[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG8hMLAXs_U&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0]&#xA;(Amazed at getting this to work, actually. I&amp;rsquo;m *so* not a programmer!)</description>

      <title>Bare Wires – text to screech</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/jsvdw_hugo/posts/2008-11-29-bare-wires-text-to-screech/</link>

      <description>Hers is a very early and approximate proof-of-concept video of a possible text-to-screech interface for &amp;lsquo;Bare Wires&amp;rsquo;;&#xA;[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npii4-3awcQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0]&#xA;The idea is to have a laptop and screen onstage, visible to the audience. The setup is used by various performers during the piece, in various ways; to address the audience, or to direct an improvisation, ask questions, tell a story… anything, really.&#xA;&amp;rsquo;text-to-screech&amp;rsquo; is my coining for taking familiar text-to-speak technology built into many modern computers, and mangle it, creatively misuse it.</description>

      <title>Bare Wires</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m putting in a proposal to Cryptic Nights to do a show called, to give it its full title, Ted Edwards proudly presents Bare Wires - Live in concert or just Bare Wires for short. Below I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered together in one place some relevant video and other documentation;&#xA;&amp;lsquo;The Other Other Hand&amp;rsquo; is pretty much fully documented from initial ideas to final performance at workingtitle08.blogspot.com - the best place to start is probably the three-minute preview video at the top of that page, also available on YouTube.</description>
